### [](#header-3)About Me
I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Notre Dame. I was previously a postdoc researcher at the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) --during the 2017-2018 academic year. I'm a fairly-recent graduate from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. There I completed a Ph.D. in applied math under Dr. Monika Neda. 

Apart from my research and teaching career, my main personal interests revolve around cycling *–pun absolutely intended*. Be it road or cyclocross racing, randonneuring, or simply commuting, it’s an infectious hobby and I'm always willing chat about it.

### [](#header-3)Research Interests
My research interests, broadly-stated, include topics in numerical analysis, scientific computing, and computational fluid dynamics. My work to date has centered largely around finite element methods, though I do have experience with Some examplies include techniques used to approximate turbulent flow regimes, and how sensitive these models are to perturbations of their tuning parameters. The class of models I have the most experience with are large eddy simulation models (LES), which are widely applied in engineering and atmospheric sciences.

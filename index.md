### [](#header-3)About Me

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the US Air Force Institute of Technology. (My less-lengthy, more-official page can be found [here](https://www.afit.edu/BIOS/bio.cfm?facID=398)). I'm a fairly-recent graduate from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. There, I completed a Ph.D. in applied mathematics under Dr. Monika Neda. 

Apart from my mathematics research and teaching career, my main personal interests revolve around cycling *--pun, regratabbly, unintended.* Be it racing, touring, or commuting, it's a hobby that can handly turn into a full time job.

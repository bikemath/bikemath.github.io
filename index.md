My name is Dana Ernst and I am an associate professor in the <a href="http://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/">Department of Mathematics and Statistics</a> at <a href="http://nau.edu">Northern Arizona University</a> in <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Flagstaff,+AZ&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=57.161276,109.511719&amp;oq=fl&amp;hnear=Flagstaff,+Coconino,+Arizona&amp;t=m&amp;z=12">Flagstaff, AZ</a>.  This site is part of the <a href="http://boolesrings.org">Booles' Rings</a> network of academic home pages/blogs.

My primary research interests are in the interplay between combinatorics and algebraic structures. More specifically, I study the combinatorics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxeter_group">Coxeter groups</a> and their associated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecke_algebra">Hecke algebras</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazhdan%E2%80%93Lusztig_polynomial">Kazhdan-Lusztig theory</a>, generalized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperley-Lieb_algebra">Temperley-Lieb algebras</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_algebra">diagram algebras</a>, and <a href="http://www.emis.de/journals/SLC/books/heaps.ps">heaps of pieces</a>. By employing combinatorial tools such as diagram algebras and heaps of pieces, one can gain insight into algebraic structures associated to Coxeter groups, and, conversely, the corresponding structure theory can often lead to surprising combinatorial results. More recently, my research has expanded into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory">combinatorial game theory</a> (joint with <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/ns46/">Nandor Sieben</a> and <a href="http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~bbenesh/">Bret Benesh</a>).  In particular, our research has focused on avoidance and achievement games involving finite groups.  See my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/scholarship/">scholarship page</a> for more information.

The combinatorial nature of my research naturally lends itself to collaborations with undergraduate students, and my goal is to incorporate undergraduates in my research as much as possible. Check out my [undergraduate research page]({{ site.baseurl }}/scholarship/undergraduate-research/) for examples of recent projects.

My interests also include the [scholarship of teaching and learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship_of_Teaching_and_Learning) (SoTL) with a focus on [inquiry-based learning](http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html) (IBL) as an approach to teaching/exploring mathematics. I am currently a Special Projects Coordinator for the [Academy of Inquiry-Based Learning](http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org) and a mentor for several new IBL practitioners.  Moreover, I actively give [talks]({{ site.baseurl }}/scholarship/talks/) and organize workshops on the benefits of IBL as well as the nuts and bolts of how to implement this approach in the mathematics classroom.

In addition to using free and open-source software, I am inspired by the recent [open-source textbook](http://iae-pedia.org/Open_Source_Textbooks) movement and I strongly believe that educators should choose free, open-source, or low cost textbooks when a viable alternative exists. For a selection of free and/or open-source textbooks, see my list located [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/free-and-open-source-textbooks/). Also, take a peek at [Rob Beezerâ€™s](http://buzzard.ups.edu) selection on [this page](http://linear.ups.edu/curriculum.html).  Moreover, the [American Institute of Mathematics](http://www.aimath.org) maintains a list of [approved open-source textbooks](http://www.aimath.org/textbooks/textbooklist.html). If you find one of the books list on any of the above links more helpful than another, please [let me know](mailto:dana.ernst@nau.edu).

Besides the occasional [blog posts]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/) I write for this site, I am currently a co-editor/author for the online column [Teaching Tidbits](http://maateachingtidbits.blogspot.com), which is sponsored by the [Mathematical Association of America](http://maa.org). We write posts every other week during the fall and spring semesters.  I have also written several posts for [Math Ed Matters](http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com), which is a another online column sponsored by the [MAA](http://maa.org). In addition, I am an editor for [Mathblogging.org](http://mathblogging.org), which is a site devoted to aggregating the multitude of math-related blogs and news sources across the Internet.  My job as editor is to select blog posts to be included in the [Editors' Picks List](http://www.mathblogging.org/posts?type=post&amp;filter0=recommender-status&amp;value0=editor).

I am a husband and a father of two incredible sons. My passions include cycling and rock climbing.  I try to do a few ultra endurance mountain bike events each year.  You can follow my cycling endeavors on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/122321). Oh, I enjoy drinking copious amounts of coffee, too.
